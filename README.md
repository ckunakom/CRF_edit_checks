# eCRF & Edit Checks
As a Clinical Data Analyst (CDA), my task include coming up with all kinds of data cleaning process to ensure that clinical data entered into the database is clean. One of the strategy is to have Edit Checks in place on the eCRf (electronic case report form) in order to eliminate a good chunk of manual data review/data cleaning tasks from the clinical monitors which ultimately saves time and human resources. Additionally, adding validations like Edit Checks enable data cleaning process at a vert early stage, data entry.

The CDA typically create the pdf version of the CRF and the specification for the Edit Checks, which get handed off to the engineers. The engineers then turn those pdf into an electronic form on the web and programmed the validation procedures according to the CDA's specification. 

## Purpose & Motivation
As a challenge to myself, I would like to employ the skills I picked up from the coding bootcamp and (1) turn the pdf version of the CRF to an eCRF and (2) programm the Edit Checks myself. 

## Methodology
### eCRF [WORK IN PROGRESS]
Using the publicly available pdf version of the Global COVID-19 Clinical Platform: Rapid Core Case Report Form (CRF) taken from the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Clinical_CRF-2020.4), I will create the eCRF in an html page following a similar format of the pdf version with some tweaks to the outline to make it easier to follow -more user-friendly! I use Bootstrap and some of my own CSS for formating.

### Edit Checks [NEXT STEP]
I will complete the following in order to deploy programmed Edit Checks:
- Creating an Edit Check specification outlining what logic to use to fire any error messages -Just like what I do at work!
- Programming each validation procedures using javaScript.

<!-- I am creating an eCRF  with programmed Edit Checks or validations procedures to demonstrate how data cleaning process can be done at an earlier stage as data entry is being completed, and why have Edit Checks is a wonderful strategy that every study team should invest in😊 -->


<!-- a demonstration of an effort to increase data quality. -->
