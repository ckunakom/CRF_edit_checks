# eCRF & Edit Checks
As a Clinical Data Analyst (CDA), my task include coming up with all kinds of data cleaning process to ensure that clinical data entered into the database is clean. One of the strategy is to have Edit Checks in place on the eCRF (electronic case report form) in order to eliminate a good chunk of manual data review/data cleaning tasks from the clinical monitors which ultimately saves time and human resources. Additionally, adding validations like Edit Checks enable data cleaning process at a vert early stage, data entry.

The CDA typically create the pdf version of the CRF and the specification for the Edit Checks, which get handed off to the engineers. The engineers then turn those pdf into an electronic form on the web and programmed the validation procedures according to the CDA's specification. 

## Purpose & Motivation
To challenge to myself, I would like to employ the skills I picked up from the coding bootcamp to fill in the engineer role and demonstrate the following: 
1. Turn the pdf version of the CRF to an eCRF.
2. Programm the Edit Checks. 

## Methodology
### eCRF -WORK IN PROGRESS-
Using the publicly available pdf version of the Global COVID-19 Clinical Platform: Rapid Core Case Report Form (CRF) taken from the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Clinical_CRF-2020.4), I will create the eCRF out of Module 1 of the form in an html page following a similar format of the pdf version with some tweaks to the outline to make it easier to follow or more user-friendly. I use Bootstrap and some of my own CSS for formating.

I googled my way into completing this project from the beginning until the end, so this is the proof of my ability to learn as I go.

ðŸ“ŒThe page is not responsive at this time. 

### Edit Checks -NEXT STEP-
I will complete the following in order to deploy programmed Edit Checks:
- Creating an Edit Check specification outlining what logic to use to fire any error messages -Just like what I do at work!
- Programming each validation procedures using javaScript.

<!-- I am creating an eCRF  with programmed Edit Checks or validations procedures to demonstrate how data cleaning process can be done at an earlier stage as data entry is being completed, and why have Edit Checks is a wonderful strategy that every study team should invest inðŸ˜Š -->


<!-- a demonstration of an effort to increase data quality. -->
